"""
This module calculates permutations considering all possible subsets of a list of distinct characters.
The calculation involves generating permutations for every subset from size 1 to n (inclusive),
where n is the total number of characters.

Total permutations for input lists ranging from 1 to 8 characters are shown as examples below:

1 Character: 
    - Only one permutation (itself).

2 Characters: 
    - Permutations of size 1 and 2: ['a', 'b', 'ab', 'ba'] resulting in a total of 3 unique permutations.

3 Characters:
    - Consider permutations from sizes 1 to 3.

4 to 8 Characters:
    - As the set size increases, the number of permutations grows significantly. This is due to combinations of different subsets and their respective permutations.

Mathematically, the sum of permutations for a list of n distinct characters from size 1 to n is expressed by:
    
    Total permutations = âˆ‘ (n! / (n-k)!) for k=1 to n

Below is the summary table for quick reference:
| Number of Characters | Total Permutations (Including Subsets) |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1                    | 1                                      |
| 2                    | 3                                      |
| 3                    | 15                                     |
| 4                    | 64                                     |
| 5                    | 325                                    |
| 6                    | 1,956                                  |
| 7                    | 13,699                                 |
| 8                    | 109,601                                |

Note:
- The rapid growth in permutations is due to both combinatorial selection of subsets and their internal arrangements.
